Contribution
============

Any pull requests would be welcome.

Please follow these creeds while writing code:

1.Use ' rather than " in python code

2.Provide enough comments and write doc strings.

3.Use four spaces as one level of indent, DO NOT USE TABS!

4.Leave one space before and after every operator in expressions.
