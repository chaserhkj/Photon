**Caution** Deprecation **Caution**
===========
Due to the active development of Ren'py project (http://www.renpy.org), we feel that the current
goal of this project is duplicated, so we decided to deprecate it.

Yet this porject may not be dead, we would discuss about this and switch the goal of this
project to some other types of game engine or game library.

The goal and status may be updated recently in the future.



Photon
======

Photon is a 2D game engine written mainly in python together with Qt.(Maybe pygame or sdl?)

[ ] Basic Library

- [ ] Common game logic (interacting, user choices, saving, resuming, etc.)

- [ ] Basic display (movement, acting, game menu system, etc.)

[ ] Basic Level APIs

- [ ] RPG engine

- [ ] Electronic Novel engine

[ ] High level API

- [ ] Simple script language to build game (easy enough for those who do not understand python)

- [ ] i18n tools (for easy translation and distribution of translated files)

- [ ] Distribution tools (for easy distribution on all systems)


Dependencies
==========

Qt4

PyQt4

Contribution
============

Any pull requests would be welcome.

Please follow these creeds while writing code:

1.Use ' rather than " in python code

2.Provide enough comments and write doc strings.

3.Use four spaces as one level of indent, DO NOT USE TABS!

4.Leave one space before and after every operator in expressions.
